Necessary Deliverables:
- A production ready web application, SPA, hosted live on the web.
- A *new git repository hosted on Github- where the codebase is maintained.
- Ideally, there will be a README.md file in your GitHub repository that explains:
    : An overview of your idea
    : A walkthrough of the code
    : Explain a technical hurdle (something you struggled with)
    : Explain some things you learned (something you enjoyed)
    : If you used technology that we haven't covered in class, provide an overview of that
    : Where next? What will you add?

OVERVIEW
- the idea of this web application is to showcase stuff that I can do (even though need mr jack and google's help) with using JS
- this web application will contain things that I have covered in class and also by myself with the help of instructors and online sources as well
- i decided to show application that i really feel comfortable with, so my sincere apologize if i didn't meet expectation of mr jack for this project
- also, all the codes are coded by myself eventhough I can just copy paste from previous class or anonymous github account
- any advise/feedback are highly appreciated that can be send to my email: aravina20@gmail.com .thank you

gitbash
mkdir mywebsite -> npm init -> npm install --save-dev parcel -> npm install react react-dom
* react for internal work and react-dom for browser work
* parcel functions as a bundler


vs code
- type=module in index.html (to use export/import)
- div id=app
- package json=> add "start" under script... (tell parcel to run things in index)


components
- are part of SPA. should be independent, reusable, testable, etc
- copy component code across and export it so that other file can require it
- set module.exports so that other files can access to it as well


index.js
- require for react, reactDOM, app
- it requires all code that react package exports save it into react variable
- use const for require so that it doesn't change
- let target = #app
- set ReactDom render App, target => component to load, where to show it


new gitbash
-create .gitignore and add nodu_modules, dist, parcel-cache, .env
- update repository in github to undo if messed up
- git add . => git commit -m "message" => git push => git status (to check for any unupdated file)



#useState only when values are updating - ways to change mutable data
#useEffect a way to make side effect happens
