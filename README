create directory using gitbash
mkdir finalproject -> npm init -> npm install --save-dev parcel -> mkdir src

vs code
- touch index html & js in src folder
- type=module in index.html (to use export/import)
- div id=app
- package json=> add "start" under script... (tell parcel to run things in index)
- parcel functions as a bundler

git bash
- install react and react dom (react for internal work and react-dom for browser work)

components
- components are part of SPA
- it should be independent, reusable, testable, etc
- 1 component per file for components created in index.js
- copy component code across and export it so that other file can require it
- set module.exports so that other files can access to it as well

index.js
- require for react, reactDOM, app
- it requires all code that react package exports save it into react variable
- use const for require so that it doesn't change
- let target = #app
- set ReactDom render App, target => component to load, where to show it

gitbash
- npm runstart (check for error asw well)

new gitbash
-create .gitignore and add nodu_modules, dist, parcel-cache
- update repository in github to undo if messed up

#useState only when values are updating - ways to change mutable data
#useEffect a way to make side effect happens
