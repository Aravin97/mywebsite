Necessary Deliverables:
- A production ready web application, SPA, hosted live on the web.
- A *new git repository hosted on Github- where the codebase is maintained.
- Ideally, there will be a README.md file in your GitHub repository that explains:
    : An overview of your idea
    : A walkthrough of the code
    : Explain a technical hurdle (something you struggled with)
    : Explain some things you learned (something you enjoyed)
    : If you used technology that we haven't covered in class, provide an overview of that
    : Where next? What will you add?

OVERVIEW
- the idea of this web application is to showcase stuff that I can do (not independently) with using JS
- this web application will contain things that I have covered in class and also by myself with the help of instructors and online sources as well
- i decided to show application that i really feel comfortable with, so my sincere apologize if i didn't meet expectation of mr jack for this project
- also, all the codes are coded by myself or code along while watching tutorial videos online.
- any advise/feedback are highly appreciated that can be send to my email: aravina20@gmail.com .thank you

gitbash
mkdir mywebsite -> npm init -> npm install --save-dev parcel -> npm install react react-dom
* react for internal work and react-dom for browser work
* parcel functions as a bundler

vs code
- type=module in index.html (to use export/import)
- div id=app
- package json=> add "start" under script... (tell parcel to run things in index)

components
- are part of SPA. should be independent, reusable, testable, etc
- copy component code across and export it so that other file can require it
- set module.exports so that other files can access to it as well

index.js
- require for react, reactDOM, app
- it requires all code that react package exports save it into react variable
- use const for require so that it doesn't change
- let target = #app
- set ReactDom render App, target => component to load, where to show it

new gitbash
-create .gitignore and add nodu_modules, dist, parcel-cache, .env
- update repository in github to undo if messed up
- git add . => git commit -m "message" => git push => git status (to check for any unupdated file)

#useState   only when values are updating - ways to change mutable data
#useEffect  a way to make side effect happens
#useRef     built-in React hook that accepts one argument as the initial value and returns a reference (used in countdown app)


Components...

Scroll page
- students are advised to maka a single page application
- followed scroll/parallax effect with the help of online videos
- set the frame at 100vw and 100vh (viewport and viewport height)

Headtab
- didnt use props for destructuring assignment, instead just created buttons to link to another page, but yet to solve it
- learned a lot bout css stuff, especially padding and margins

Intro
- a very very short brief with plain background
- to prevent it look lame, i decided to set nice background images for every app
- gradients used so that it doesnt appears brighter than the text on it

Liveclock
- pull out the date and time from new Date() function, but unsure on how to implement it
- online videos helped to finish it

Weather
- still not satisfied or uncomfortable with the usage of api in react js, need more practise with diff example

Movies
- had code along during the class, but again this react js part is very difficult
- probably won't put it for display, as there are unfinished part (if couldnt finish by due date)

Countdown
- used useRef, yet to discover more react hooks

Quiz
- not good enough to create chat app or game, so went on with quiz

Quote
- creates a random quote everytime page is reloaded or when the button is clicked

Timespend
- had done before in class
- adjust the number slightly so that it shows time spend on page in minutes instead of seconds


*the end

- it is impossible for me to do alone and i need a lot of practices as well to not make no mistake
- thank you to boss mr jack, assistant instructors, and all owner of video contents on youtube
- i have pasted the links of videos that i have watched to do certain parts, hope will be helpful to any of my frens reading this
